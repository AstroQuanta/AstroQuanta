# 👋 Hi, I’m Raj Bhattacherjee  

🎓 I’m a student of **BITS Pilani** pursuing M.Sc. Physics and B.E. EEE
🔬 I work at the intersection of **mathematics, physics, and computation**  
📚 My background is in **theoretical & mathematical physics**, with research interests spanning:  
- Algebraic/Axiomatic Quantum Field Theory (QFT), Mathematical Gauge Theories  
- Quantum Algorithms, Tensor Networks, and Computational Physics  
- Category Theory, Homological Algebra, and Non-commutative Geometry  
- Nuclear Physics (neutron–gamma pulse shape discrimination, detector modeling)

---

## 📌 Current Focus
- Building intuition for **particle physics beyond QFT basics**  
- Exploring **tensor networks for field theory simulations**  
- Learning **category theory, homological algebra, and sheaf cohomology** for physics applications  
- Understanding **quantum groups, graded Lie algebras, and braid group representations** in anyonic physics
