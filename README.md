- 👋 Hi, I’m @AstroQuanta, Raj Bhattacherjee, 2nd year undergrad student of BITS Pilani, of Physics and CS.
- 👀 I’m interested in Theoretical Particle Physics and beyond Standard Model (basically which tries to explain everything around us) along with to play with Abstract Mathematics (rigorous symbols), and Quantum Computing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Algebraic structures, Clifford Algebra, Exterior Algebra and so on... and as always Physics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on who applies Quantum Computing in Particle Physics
- 📫 How to reach me ... Email: f20220877@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in
